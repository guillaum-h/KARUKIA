**The complete AI-assisted development methodology, delivered via MCP.**

**Latest: v1.2.3** — Enriched context.json v2 for reliable inter-skill communication.

21 tools, 11 skills, 935+ security/quality/pentest checkpoints. Works with any AI platform (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot...) through the Model Context Protocol.

## What is KARUKIA?

KARUKIA is a structured development methodology built around specialized AI personas. Each persona (Neo for security, Jeffrey for architecture, Viper for pentesting, Opo for quality...) comes with its own workflow, guard rails, and knowledge base.

When you call a KARUKIA tool, the MCP server returns a complete prompt — persona identity, workflow, checklists, templates — that transforms your AI assistant into that specialist for the session.

```
You: "Run a security audit"
  -> AI calls neo tool
  -> MCP returns full Neo persona prompt + 445 security controls inline
  -> AI becomes Neo, follows the methodology, produces structured findings
```

## The Three Layers

```
Layer 1 - DEFENSIVE (Neo)     445 controls   "Is my code secure?"
Layer 2 - QUALITY (Opquast)   245 rules      "Is my app well-built?"
Layer 3 - OFFENSIVE (Viper)   245 tests      "How would a hacker break in?"
```

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20 or later.

### Step 1 — Add KARUKIA to your project

Create or edit `.mcp.json` at the root of your project:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "karukia": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["karukia-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** If the file already exists and has other MCP servers, just add the `"karukia"` key inside the existing `"mcpServers"` object.

### Step 2 — Restart your AI client

Restart Claude Code (`/quit` then relaunch) or your IDE. The 21 KARUKIA tools are now available.

> On first launch, `npx` downloads the package automatically (~175 KB). Subsequent launches use the cached version.

### Step 3 — Configure your project

Tell your AI:

> "karukia install"

KARUKIA scans your project, detects your stack, and generates configuration files (security scope, CLAUDE.md, memory structure).

### Step 4 — Start working

Just describe what you need in natural language:

> "karukia: add user authentication"
> "karukia: audit security"
> "karukia: run a pentest"

The orchestrator (`auto`) analyzes your request and routes to the right specialists automatically.

> **Tip:** You only need two commands: `karukia install` (once) then `karukia` + your request (always). For direct control, ask for a specific skill: "karukia neo", "karukia viper", "karukia jeffrey". Say "karukia start" anytime for a full guide.

### Where to put the config

| Client | File | Scope |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Claude Code CLI** | `.mcp.json` at project root | This project only |
| **Claude Code CLI** | `~/.claude.json` (home directory) | All your projects |
| **Claude Desktop** | `claude_desktop_config.json` | Global |
| **Cursor** | `.cursor/mcp.json` at project root | This project only |
| **Windsurf** | MCP settings panel | Global |

---

## Global Installation (optional)

If you want KARUKIA available in all your projects without adding `.mcp.json` each time:

```bash
npm install -g karukia-mcp
```

Then add to your global AI config (`~/.claude.json` for Claude Code):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "karukia": {
      "command": "karukia-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Full security audit

> "Run a security audit on my project"

Your AI calls `neo` — becomes the Neo security auditor — follows the methodology — produces structured findings with severity, file:line references, and remediation steps.

### Build a feature with guardrails

> "karukia jeffrey: implement user authentication"

Your AI calls `jeffrey` — becomes the Jeffrey architect — implements with TDD, then chains to Neo for security validation (rejection loop: if Neo rejects, Jeffrey fixes, max 3 iterations).

### Pentest your app

> "karukia viper"

Your AI calls `viper` — deploys the Brigade methodology with 16 specialized agents across Recon, Surface Analysis, and Exploitation phases.

### Orchestrate everything

> "karukia: add a logout button and audit security"

Your AI calls `auto` — analyzes the request — routes to the right skill(s) — manages the chain.

## Why KARUKIA

KARUKIA is a structured AI-assisted development methodology built around three principles:

1. **Separation of concerns** — Security, quality, and implementation are separate disciplines handled by separate AI personas.
2. **Formal checkpoints over gut feeling** — 935 documented checkpoints beat "I think it's fine."
3. **Defense in depth** — Defensive audit first, quality validation second, offensive testing last.

Built from real-world experience securing a healthcare SaaS application to HDS 2.0 / ISO 27001 standards.
