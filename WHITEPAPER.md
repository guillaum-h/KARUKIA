## 1. The Problem

AI assistants (Claude, GPT, Copilot) are powerful but generic. When asked for a security audit, the AI improvises: it knows OWASP concepts but doesn't follow a structured methodology. Results vary from session to session with no guaranteed exhaustiveness.

**Real-world consequences:**

- Vulnerabilities slip through because the AI "forgets" to check certain points
- No traceability: impossible to prove a control was performed
- No reproducibility: two audits of the same code yield different results
- Zero compliance: frameworks (ISO 27001, SOC 2, HDS) require formal evidence

## 2. The KARUKIA Solution

KARUKIA solves this by injecting a **complete methodology** directly into the AI's context, on demand.

### How it works

KARUKIA is an MCP server (Model Context Protocol) — Anthropic's open standard for connecting tools to AI. When the user requests an audit, the MCP server returns a **monolithic prompt** containing:

1. **Persona identity** — name, expertise, communication style
2. **Workflow** — mandatory steps, in order, with validation gates
3. **Checklists** — all relevant control points, inline in the prompt
4. **Templates** — expected output format (tables, scores, verdicts)
5. **Guard rails** — non-negotiable rules (e.g., "every finding must cite file:line")

The AI receives this prompt and **becomes** the specialist for the duration of the session. It cannot "forget" a control — it's written in its context.

### The MCP Protocol

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard that allows any AI client to connect to tool servers. KARUKIA works with:

- **Claude Code** (CLI)
- **Claude Desktop**
- **Cursor**
- **Windsurf**
- **Any MCP-compatible client**

Installation is a single line:

```bash
npx karukia-mcp
```

No account, no API key, no data sent externally. The server runs locally on the developer's machine.

## 3. Architecture

### Local transport (default)

```
Developer <-> AI Client <-> [stdio] <-> KARUKIA MCP Server (local)
                                            |
                                            ├── 11 skills (prompt builders)
                                            ├── 24 checklists (935+ points)
                                            └── Memory system (sessions, knowledge)
```

The server communicates via **stdio** (standard input/output). No network port opened, no HTTP calls. Everything stays on the local machine.

### Remote transport (enterprise)

```
Team <-> AI Clients <-> [HTTPS] <-> KARUKIA MCP Server (Cloud Run)
                                        |
                                        ├── Bearer auth (MCP_API_KEY)
                                        ├── Per-session rate limiting
                                        ├── Audit trail (Pino logs)
                                        └── Same engine, same checklists
```

For team deployments, KARUKIA supports a **streamable HTTP** transport deployable on your own infrastructure (Cloud Run, Kubernetes, VM). Bearer token authentication, structured logs, rate limiting.

### What the server returns

Each MCP tool returns a **monolithic prompt** — a single text block containing everything the AI needs. No chain of calls, no RAG, no vector database. Just a well-constructed prompt.

Simplified example for `neo` (security audit):

```
[GUARD v2 — non-negotiable obligations]
+
[Neo persona — identity, style, expertise]
+
[Workflow — 5 mandatory steps]
+
[OWASP checklist — 62 inline controls]
+
[ISO 27001 checklist — 93 inline controls]
+
[Output template — table format + verdict]
```

Typical skill prompt size: 15-40 KB depending on active checklists.

## 4. The Three Audit Layers

### Layer 1 — Defensive Audit (Neo)

```
  ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
  ║    ●─────────────────────────────────────────●       ║
  ║    │   ◉               N E O               ◉ │       ║
  ║    │        Auditeur Cybersécurité            │       ║
  ║    ●─────────────────────────────────────────●       ║
  ║   OWASP · HDS · ISO 27001 · SOC 2 · PCI · HIPAA     ║
  ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**Persona:** Neo, senior cybersecurity auditor.

**Method:** Point-by-point verification of each applicable control. Every finding must cite the file and line. Every verdict is either COMPLIANT or NON-COMPLIANT with evidence.

**Supported frameworks:**

| Framework | Controls | Scope |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| OWASP Security Baseline | 62 | Every web app |
| HDS 2.0 | 52 | Health data (France) |
| ISO 27001:2022 | 93 | Enterprise ISMS |
| SOC 2 Type II | 74 | SaaS (US market) |
| PCI-DSS v4.0 | 97 | Payment processing |
| HIPAA | 67 | Health data (US) |

**Output:** Findings table with severity (CRITICAL / MAJOR / MINOR / INFO), checklist reference, file:line, and overall verdict APPROVED or REJECTED.

**Chain:** Neo is systematically called after Jeffrey (implementation) to validate the security of produced code. If Neo rejects, Jeffrey fixes — maximum 3 iteration loop.

### Layer 2 — Quality Audit (Opo / Opquast)

**Persona:** Opo, web quality guardian.

**Method:** Verification of 245 Opquast v5.0 rules across 14 thematic categories. Two modes:

- **opo** — Targeted validation on modified files (fast, before merge)
- **audit_opquast** — Exhaustive audit of all 245 rules (complete, with scoring)

**Categories:** Content, personal data, e-commerce, forms, identification, images and media, internationalization, links, navigation, newsletter, presentation, security UX, server and performance, structure and code.

**Based on:** [Opquast](https://www.opquast.com/) — the French web quality reference used by 15,000+ professionals.

### Layer 3 — Offensive Audit (Viper)

**Persona:** V.I.P.E.R., certified ethical hacker (OSCP, OSCE, OSWE, GWAPT).

**Method:** BRIGADE methodology with 16 specialized agents across 3 phases:

1. **Reconnaissance** (5 agents) — Backend, frontend, config, deps, data
2. **Attack surface** (3 agents) — Control matrix, data flow, STRIDE
3. **Exploit verification** (5-6 agents) — Per OWASP category + cloud + supply chain

**Scoring:** CVSS v4.0 for each finding, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, realistic attack narratives.

**Checklists:**

| Checklist | Tests | Scope |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| OWASP WSTG v5 | 100 | Web penetration testing |
| Cloud Platform | 80+ | Firebase, GCP, AWS, Azure |
| Healthcare | 50+ | PHI, encryption, medical data |
| Attack Scenarios | 15+ | PTES templates, MITRE ATT&CK |

---

## 5. The Orchestrator (Auto)

The `auto` tool is the main entry point. The user describes their request in natural language, and the orchestrator:

1. **Analyzes** the request (type, scope, complexity)
2. **Routes** to the correct skill chain
3. **Manages the rejection loop** (if Neo rejects, Jeffrey fixes, max 3 iterations)
4. **Consolidates** the final report

### Routing table

| Request type | Skill chain |
|-------------|-------------|
| Frontend feature | Jeffrey → Neo → Opo |
| Backend feature | Jeffrey → Neo |
| Bug fix | Jeffrey → Neo |
| Security audit | Neo only |
| Pentest | Viper only |
| Quality audit | audit_opquast only |
| Risk analysis | ebios_rm_audit only |
| Documentation | doc_refactor only |
| Infrastructure | terraform_update → Neo |
| Hardening | security_hardening → Neo |

### Usage

```
"karukia: add user authentication"
    → Jeffrey implements → Neo validates security → Opo checks quality

"karukia: audit the security of my project"
    → Neo audits point by point → structured report

"karukia: run a pentest"
    → Viper deploys 16 agents → CVSS scoring → attack narratives
```

## 6. Memory System

KARUKIA maintains a structured memory across sessions:

```
KARUKIA/
└── memory/
    ├── INDEX.md              — Session index
    ├── sessions/             — One session per task
    │   └── YYYY-MM-DD_xxx/
    │       ├── task_plan.md  — Plan and objectives
    │       ├── findings.md   — Discoveries
    │       ├── progress.md   — Progress log
    │       └── context.json  — Machine-readable context
    ├── knowledge/
    │   ├── patterns.md       — Recurring project patterns
    │   └── lessons.md        — Lessons learned
    └── config/
        └── security-scope.md — Active frameworks and constraints
```

This allows KARUKIA to **capitalize** on previous sessions: detected patterns, lessons learned, documented architectural decisions.

## 7. For Regulated Industries

### The Real Cost of Certification

Obtaining HDS, ISO 27001, or SOC 2 certification is expensive — not because auditors are incompetent, but because **documentation is missing on audit day**. Evidence is scattered across Jira tickets, emails, and unstructured commits. Fixes were applied in a rush, with no traceability.

**KARUKIA does not replace the human auditor. It prepares the evidence dossier.**

### What KARUKIA Produces for Your Certification

| Auditor's Requirement | What KARUKIA Generates |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| Control evidence | Findings traced with file:line reference |
| Risk mapping | EBIOS RM report (5 ANSSI workshops) |
| Technical security policy | `security-scope.md` generated by `install` |
| Per-framework compliance | Neo reports (HDS, ISO, SOC 2, PCI-DSS…) |
| Remediation history | Structured cross-session memory |
| Documented pentest | Viper report with CVSS v4 + MITRE ATT&CK |

### Why KARUKIA Is Different

| Criterion | Generic Audit Tools | KARUKIA |
|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| Framework coverage | One at a time | 6 frameworks + EBIOS RM in one tool |
| Evidence building | Manual snapshots | Structured cross-session memory |
| Full cycle | Audit only | Code → Security → Quality → Pentest |
| Origin | Theoretical | Built from a real HDS/ISO 27001 certification |
| Web quality | Absent | 245 Opquast rules (French web quality standard) |

### Built from Real Experience

KARUKIA was built from direct experience with HDS 2.0 and ISO 27001 certification in the French healthcare sector. The checklists are not theoretical — they reflect what a real auditor asks, point by point.

---

## 8. Use Cases

### SaaS Startup — SOC 2 compliance

1. `karukia install` — detects stack (React + Node.js + PostgreSQL)
2. `karukia neo` with SOC 2 + OWASP frameworks — full audit
3. Findings become hardening chantiers
4. `karukia jeffrey` implements fixes → Neo revalidates
5. Exportable report for the SOC 2 auditor

### Healthcare Application — HDS certification

1. `karukia install` — detects health data, activates HDS 2.0
2. `karukia neo` with HDS + ISO 27001 frameworks — defensive audit
3. `karukia viper` — healthcare-specific offensive pentest
4. `karukia ebios_rm_audit` — formal ANSSI risk analysis
5. Complete documentation for the certification dossier

### Development Team — continuous quality

1. `karukia install` on the shared project
2. Developers use `karukia: [task]` daily
3. Every feature goes through Jeffrey → Neo → Opo automatically
4. Full audits (`neo`, `viper`, `audit_opquast`) are run periodically
